Codoyster can help!</p><p>I build new websites from scratch. Just provide design of how you see your future site and some feature's description and get your own homepage, corporative page, restaurant/shop/agency/whatever website.</p><h3>What is static website?</h3><p>\"Static\" means: fixed content. Since static Web pages contain fixed code, the content of each page does not change unless it is manually updated by the webmaster. Such site can be built by simply creating a few HTML pages and publishing them to a Web server. However, static doesn't mean \"fixed\" design or solid block of text. You can have all animations and transitions you wish on your website. Codoyster.com is a static website for example.</p>",
